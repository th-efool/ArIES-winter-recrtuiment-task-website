# 🎮 ArIES Winter Game Dev Jam — Assignment Page

**Live site:** [https://aries-winter-task.vercel.app/](https://aries-winter-task.vercel.app/)

A learning-first Winter Game Development Assignment portal built for **ArIES (Artificial Intelligence & Electronics), IIT Roorkee**.

This project is not just a landing page — it is a **structured learning scaffold** designed to onboard absolute beginners into **real game development systems**, while still leaving space for depth, experimentation, and personal direction.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Most programming exercises are solved once and forgotten.

Game development is different.

Here, participants:

* build **interactive systems**
* reason about **state, logic, physics, input, AI**
* learn by **constructing worlds with rules they define**

The goal of this assignment is **not visual polish**.
The goal is **understanding systems deeply enough to explain them**.

> A small, well-understood game beats a large, shallow one.

## ✨ What This Page Does

* Presents **curated game development tracks** (FPS, Parkour, 2D, Horror, AR, Open)
* Links **structured, follow-along learning playlists** (Unity / Unreal)
* Explains **how projects are evaluated** (depth > polish)
* Prevents fragmented learning by encouraging **shared system understanding**
* Acts as a **single source of truth** for instructions, resources, and expectations

---

## 🧩 Assignment Tracks

Each track includes:

* supported engine(s)
* difficulty level
* key systems to implement
* submission requirements
* direct links to guided learning playlists

### Available Tracks

* **First-Person Shooter** (Core 3D Systems)
* **First-Person Parkour** (Movement & Momentum)
* **2D Platformer** (2D Fundamentals)
* **Horror Game** (Atmosphere & Systems)
* **AR Solar System** (AR / Experimental)
* **AR Dart Board** (AR Interaction)
* **Open Track** (Anything Goes)

Tracks are intentionally **system-oriented**, not genre-locked.

---

## 👥 Teams & Learning Structure

* Solo participation is allowed
* Teams of up to **3 members**
* Larger teams require approval

### Important Guideline

Avoid splitting work into:

* “only art”
* “only UI”
* “only coding”

Instead:

* everyone should engage with **core systems**
* everyone should leave with **the same foundational understanding**

Recommended approach:

* split by **learning tracks**, then integrate systems into one game

Example:

* FPS track (weapons, AI)
* Parkour track (movement, traversal)
  → combine into a **parkour shooter**

---

## 📦 Submission Requirements

Each submission must include:

* **Playable build**
* **Short demo video**
* **GitHub repository**
* **Written report** explaining:

  * systems implemented
  * design decisions
  * challenges faced

Judging prioritizes:

1. **Understanding & Depth**
2. **Clarity & Presentability**

An official scoring breakdown is released separately.
